Emotion Detection Using CNN
Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for emotion detection using a dataset of grayscale facial images. The model is trained to classify facial images into different emotion categories such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, etc. TensorFlow is used to build and train the model to improve the model's performance.

Features
CNN-based model: Utilizes a convolutional neural network to extract spatial features from facial images.
Grayscale images: Trained on a dataset of grayscale images to focus on facial expressions rather than color features.
Emotion classification: Accurately classifies emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, etc.
TensorFlow framework: The model is built and trained using TensorFlow and Keras.
Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib

Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset of grayscale facial images. You can download a dataset like FER2013 or any similar dataset of facial expressions.

Usage
Preprocess the dataset and apply data augmentation techniques.
Train the model using TensorFlow and monitor its performance on the validation set.
Once trained, use the model to predict emotions on new grayscale facial images.
Model Training
The CNN model is trained using the following parameters:

Optimizer: Adam
Loss function: Categorical Crossentropy
Metrics: Accuracy


Results
After training, the model was able to accurately classify facial images into different emotion categories, achieving high accuracy on both training and validation sets.
